# MisSpans: Fine-grained False Span Identification in Cross-Domain Fake News

This is a multi-domain, human-annotated benchmark for span (word)-level misinformation detection and analysis, consisting of paired real and fake news stories. MisSpans defines three complementary tasks: 
- MisSpansIdentity for pinpointing false spans within sentences,
- MisSpansType for categorising false spans by misinformation type,
- MisSpansExplanation for providing rationales grounded in identified spans.
